# Home Dashboard
- The dPhish Home Dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of the entity's `security posture`, providing a `risk score` along with key insights from the `Do`, `Drill`, and `Detect` modules. It presents statistics and analysis on `phishing simulations`, `awareness drills`, and `threat detection activities`. This dashboard serves as a central hub, giving administrators a clear view of ongoing activities, performance metrics, and areas that require attention.

## Main

![Home-Phish dashboard main!](../../assets/dashboard/main.png "Home-Phish dashboard main")

- **The main dashboard is divided into two sections:**
    
    1. **Risk Score**: This section displays the current risk score of the entity, based on the activities and progress of targets, drill usersâ€™ awareness, and the security controls by emulation campaigns.
    2. **Risk Score Chart**: This section provides daily visual representation of the risk score over time, highlighting trends, fluctuations, and the impact of security efforts, helping to track improvements or identify areas needing attention.

- **Breakdown of Risk Score Calculations:**
    1. **Phishing Simulation and Adversary Emulation**: Contribute 60% of the total risk score.
    2. **Awareness Course Progress**: Contributes 30% of the total risk score.
    3. **Leaked Credentials**: Contribute 10% of the total risk score, considering only those with an open or in-progress status.
        - A single target with leaked credentials contributes the full 10%.
        - For multiple targets, the average contribution per target is capped at a maximum of 10%.

- **Breakdown of the 10% Contribution:**
    1. **Malware Logs**: Represent 80% of the 10% risk.
    2. **Public Breaches**: Represent 20% of the 10% risk.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Leaked Credentials Engine` runs every 24 hours at 12:00 AM to search for any leaked credentials from malware or public breaches for targets whose emails are imported into the tenant.

1. **Campaigns Statistics**: This section provides an overview of the total number of emails sent in campaigns, the number of targets exploited in case the campaign type is email with attachment whether the attachment in email or usb, credentials submitted by targets, targets reporting simulation emails, and USBs opened by targets.
2. **Campaigns Timeline**: This section provides daily insights into total campaign trackers (e.g., link_opened, credentials_saved, etc.).
3. **Campaigns Tracker Categories**: Breaks down the specific numbers of trackers achieved by targets during simulation campaigns. You can see the numbers by hovering over the desirable tracker.

8. **Top 5 Reporting Employees**: Identifies the top 5 targets who `reported` phishing simulation emails using the `add-on`.
9. **Top 5 Faild Departments**: Shows the top 5 departments with the highest failure rates, represented as a percentage chart. This analysis requires the department field to be declared for each target in the tenant.
10. **Top 5 Faild Targets**: Displays the top 5 targets who failed in simulation campaigns by achieving the success category of the campaign (e.g., link_opened, credentials_saved, etc.).
