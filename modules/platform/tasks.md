# Overview
> The `Tasks tab` displays all launched tasks across the tenant, including awareness campaigns, regular phishing, and adversary emulation campaigns. Admins can terminate ongoing tasks either directly from the Tasks tab or through task-specific management panel. For example, to terminate an adversary emulation, navigate to Do > Emulations > Campaign_Name > Actions > View, and use the Launch button to see the tasks history and terminate the chosen one.
