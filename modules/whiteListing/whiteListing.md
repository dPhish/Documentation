## Overview

> To ensure the successful execution of a campaign, certain whitelisting configurations must be completed beforehand. Each campaign typically includes an SMTP sender for delivering emails, a phishing link within the email, and tracking mechanisms like email open tracking (via a zero-pixel image).

## Based on this, the following whitelisting is required: 

1. Add the sender to the mail gateway  

2. Add the sender to the email server whitelist. 

3. Whitelist the domain on the web proxy (web filtering)
