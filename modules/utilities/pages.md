## Overview

> `Pages` are used in campaigns to either phish target credentials (phishing) or raise awareness and deliver a message (announcement). You can manage pages from this tab, including creating new pages and editing existing ones.

# Main Page

Upon accessing the `Pages tab`, users encounter key indicators at the top of the page, displaying the total number of pages. The interface includes pagination controls, allowing users to set the number of pages displayed per page by adjusting options at the bottom of the page.
