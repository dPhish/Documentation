# Overview
> This campaign type is designed to test the effectiveness of email security controls, such as email gateways and email sandboxes. The key difference between emulation and phishing campaigns is that emulation campaigns do not require whitelisting the sender, as the goal is to test the email gateway system under real-world attack conditions.

### Emulation Campaigns Management

- **Main** Upon accessing the `Emulations tab`, users will encounter key indicators at the top of the page, which display the number of created emulation-campaigns. The interface is paginated, enabling users to customize the number of emulation-campaigns displayed. You can customize the number of emulation-campaigns displayed by adjusting the pagination at the bottom of the page.

### Emulation Features

    1. **Campaign Name**

    2. **Description** A brief overview of the Emulation campaign, such as:

        - **Intervals (Sec)** The interval is the time, in seconds, that separates each attack when the emulation campaign is launched. Setting an interval is important because it allows you to test the effectiveness of security controls. Sending attacks too quickly could cause them to be blocked by rules unrelated to individual payloads, rather than by the mail gateway's targeted defenses.

        - **Sender** Choose the sender responsible for dispatching the campaign attacks to the targets or the security control system.
            > [!NOTE]
            > You only need to choose one target for the emulation campaign, as all targets are protected by the same security control system. Whatever applies to one target will apply to the rest

        - **Actions**
            - **View**: View detailed information about the emulation.
            - **Edit**: Modify the emulation's configurations.
