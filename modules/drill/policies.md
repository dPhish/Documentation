# Overview
> The Policies section allows administrators to upload and manage organizational policies, which Drill users can access via the LMS under the "Policies" tab. Once a policy is uploaded, users can view it in the system and are given the option to accept it after reviewing.

Key features for administrators include:

- **Uploading Policies**: Administrators can upload new policy documents, making them accessible to users in the LMS.
- **Managing Policies**: Policies can be edited, updated, or deleted as needed.
- **User Interaction Tracking**: Administrators can track user engagement with each policy, including who viewed, opened, or accepted it.

## Main Page

In the `Policies tab`, key indicators at the top display the total count of policies. Administrators can adjust the pagination settings at the bottom of the page to control the number of policies displayed per page, enabling efficient navigation through the list.
