# Overview
> The Groups feature enables administrators to organize users into specific groups, making it easier to assign courses to multiple users at once. This setup is particularly useful for segmenting company departments into distinct groups, allowing each department to include its relevant users for streamlined training and management. 

## Main Page

In the `Groups tab`, key indicators at the top display the total number of groups created. Administrators can adjust the pagination at the bottom of the page to set the number of groups shown per page, allowing for easy navigation through the category list.
