## CSS issue in templates

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).



## Is the tracker host empty?

This issue may be caused by the lack of tracking hosts added to the tenant. The solution to this issue is:

- Navigate to `Settings`, then select `Platform`. Add the tracker hosts seperated by commas, and ensure to save the new settings afterward.

- If you do not have the tracker hosts associated with the tenant, contact the cybersecurity department to obtain them.

## Couldn’t find the Announcement template or the Announcement page?

Navigate to the `Utilities` module, select the `template` or `page` you want to use, then click on Actions and choose `Edit`. Ensure that it is assigned to the `announcement category`.

To ensure that the template or page appears during the creation of the announcement campaign, it must be assigned to an announcement category
